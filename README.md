# Emotion-Detection-Application

The "Emotion Detection Application" uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to identify human emotions from images, leveraging a rich dataset that includes a variety of facial expressions. This dataset is instrumental in training the model to recognize different emotions accurately. The application is built with Keras for model training. A Haar Cascade classifier is employed for efficient facial detection in images or video streams. The project's model achieves a notable accuracy rate, demonstrating its effectiveness in classifying emotions, though the exact accuracy figure varies depending on the complexity of the emotions and the quality of the input data.
